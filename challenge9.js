//Create an array of objects with at least 2 key value pairs. The objects should 
//all have the same keys, and the array should contain at least 3 objects.
//Create a function that accepts the array of objects as an argument.
//Print the value of the second key in each object to the console. 
//Use dot-notation to access the values.
//After printing the values in step 3, change the values of the second key 
//in every object to something new.
//Prove the change worked by printing the second key in each object to the 
//console, which should show the new value. Use bracket-notation to access the values this time.
